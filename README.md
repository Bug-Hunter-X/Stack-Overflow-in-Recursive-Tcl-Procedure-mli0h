This repository demonstrates a common error in Tcl: stack overflow due to uncontrolled recursion. The `bug.tcl` file contains a recursive procedure that lacks a proper termination condition, leading to excessive function calls and ultimately a stack overflow. The solution, in `bugSolution.tcl`, replaces the flawed recursion with iteration to avoid the stack overflow issue.  The example highlights the importance of carefully managing recursion depth in Tcl programs.
